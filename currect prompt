If you want, I can extend this with Oracle RDF backend support and SPARQL entity matching rules.
Do you want me to now add the CPE parsing and ingestion from NVD feed into RDF so matching works end-to-end? That will connect the vulnerability data to installed software directly.


We can extend query-time fuzzy matching to also include vendor & version similarity in one combined score, and even integrate Levenshtein distance for better matching than difflib.
